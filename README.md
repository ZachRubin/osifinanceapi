## Quickstart
Getting started with osifinanceAPI is easy.

Like most API clients, osifinanceAPI exposes a single class that provides access to the rest of the API: Osifinance.

The first thing to do is instantiate a new Osifinance object by providing your Osifinance instanceâ€™s root API URL and a valid API key. Additionally, you can include constant financial data such as your filing status or salary.

```
# Import the Osifinance class
from osifinanceAPI import Osifinance
from osifinanceAPI import states

# OSI Finance API key
API_KEY = "p@$$w0rd"

# Initialize a new Osifinance object
osi = Osifinance(API_KEY)
```

You can now use osi to begin making API calls.

# Working with Osifinance Objects
osifinanceAPI converts the JSON responses from the host website into Pandas dataframes.

```
# Get income taxes
>>> df_income_taxes = osi.taxes_income(filing_status='single', agi=100000)

# Access the total taxes
>>> df_income_taxes.taxes.total

# State tax information can be found in the respective state files
>>> help(osi.states.alabama)
>>> help(osi.states.alabama.income)
```
