Quickstart
Getting started with the OSI Finance API is easy.

Like most API clients, the OSI Finance API exposes a single class that provides access to the rest of the API: Osifinance.

The first thing to do is instantiate a new Osifinance object by providing your Osifinance instanceâ€™s root API URL and a valid API key. Additionally, you can include constant financial data such as your filing status or salary.

'''
# Import the Osifinance class
from osifinanceapi import Osifinance
from osifinanceapi import states

# OSI Finance API key
API_KEY = "p@$$w0rd"

# Initialize a new Osifinance object
osi = Osifinance(API_KEY)

You can now use osi to begin making API calls.

Working with Osifinance Objects
The OSI Finance API converts the JSON responses from the host website into Pandas dataframes.

# Get income taxes
>>> df_income_taxes = osi.taxes_income(filing_status='single', agi=100000)

# Access the total taxes
>>> df_income_taxes.taxes.total

# State tax information can be found in the respective state files
>>> help(osi.states.alabama)
>>> help(osi.states.alabama.income)
'''
